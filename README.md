# 🧬 Self-Reproducing Code (Quine Lineage)

> "A program that 'breeds' by copying its own DNA and only surviving if it’s perfect."

### 📢 Latest Status
<!-- LATEST_STATUS_START -->
> A new version of the quine has been born today! The code successfully mutated and passed the 'mirror test'—it can still print itself perfectly. The unique tag for this generation is 2026-03-27-51edc1.

### 📖 The Analogy
Imagine a robot that has its own assembly manual printed on its chest. The robot's only job is to build an exact copy of itself using that manual. 

In computer science, we call this a "Quine." This repository takes it a step further: every day, the code tries to mutate slightly (like adding a timestamp or a new variable). However, it only keeps the change if the new version can still successfully print its own source code. It’s digital evolution where only the "perfect" copies survive.

### 🌱 How it Evolves
Every day, the repository undergoes a survival test:
1. **Mutation**: The [Master Code](quine.py) is modified with a new "tag."
2. **The Mirror Test**: The new code is executed. If its output exactly matches its new source code, it passes.
3. **Selection**: Only successful mutations are committed to the repo. Failures are discarded.
4. **The Ledger**: Every attempt is recorded in the [Evolution Log](evolution.log).
